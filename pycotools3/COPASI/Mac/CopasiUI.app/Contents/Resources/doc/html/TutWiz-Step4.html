  <h3>Step 4: Calculating a Time Course</h3><br>
	</center>
	<p>
In the tree on the left under Tasks you can find the entry called <em>Time
Course</em>. Selecting this entry in the tree will bring you to the time course
settings dialog.<br>
<center>
(<a href="#Time Course" name="Time Course">Click here</a> to go to the <em>Time Course</em> dialog)
</center>
<br>
Here you can set all parameters for calculating a time course
like starting time, end time, how many data points are to be stored and, last
but not least, the method for calculating the trajectory. So far you can choose between
deterministic simulation or stochastic simulation. Depending on the simulation
method, you have some more parameters that can be changed in the table toward
the bottom of the dialog, but the default values should suffice most of the
time.

	<p>
Once all values are set, the run button can be used to excecute the timecourse
calculation. To see the results for the calculation, the <em>Time Course</em> node
in the tree on the left has a subnode called <em>Result</em>, it contains a
table with the calculated values for all variables (This only works if the <em>Save Result in Memory</em> checkbox is checked). The <em>Result</em> window
also has a button that allows saving the results to a file.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the results of a calculation are to large to be stored in memory, or
you might want to have other items in the result that are not in the <em>Result</em> table.
For those cases, COPASI provides means to specify so called reports in which
the user can specify the items that are to be written to a file.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to create a report is to choose one of the predefined report
with COPASI's <em>Output Assistant</em> which can be started by clicking the
button with the same name at the bottom of the screen.

</p>
<p>
The dialog features a large number of predefined reports as well as plots. Each item on the right side of the dialog, when selected, provides a description on the left side of the dialog.
By clicking the <big><b><code>Create!</code></b></big> button, when a item has been selected, the
corresponding plot or report is created.
</p>
<p>
If the item that has been created was a plot, everything is set and next time,
the corresponding task is run, a plot window should appear that shows the
selected plot.
</p>
<p>
If the selected item however was a report, you have to choose a file to which
the report will write its contents. This can be done by clicking on the
<big><b><code>Report</code></b></big> button at the bottom of the <em>Time Course</em> window. The
dialog that pops up lets you choose the report which you want to associate with
a file (since a task can have more than one report) and it lets you specify a
filename.
</p>
<p>Once you are done, just click the <big><b><code>Confirm</code></b></big> button and next time you
run the task, a file with the contents of the report will be written to disk.
