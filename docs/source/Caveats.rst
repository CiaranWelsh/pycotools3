Caveats
=======

This is a list of known problems currently in Pycotools

Non-Ascii Characters
--------------------

* Non-ascii characters are minimally supported and can break PyCoTools
* Do not use unusual characters or naming systems (i.e. A reaction name called "A -> B" will break pycotools)

Parameter Estimation
--------------------

Currently we cannot setup:

* Affected _experiments in parameter estimations


Duplicate Names
===============

In COPASI we can have (say) a global quantity and a metaboltie
with the same name because they are different entities. This is not
supported in Pycotools and you must use unique names for every model
component

Known Bugs
==========
* viz.PlotTimeCourseEnsembles doesn't work properly if user is fitting multiple _experiments with multiple conditions (i.e. defined by independent variables)
