The viz module
==============

The viz module exists to make visualising simulation output quick and easy for common patterns, such as plotting time courses or comparing parameter estimation output to experimental data. However it should be emphasised that the `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries are always close to hand in Python.

The viz module is currently in a state of rebuilding and so I only describe here the features which currently work.
