# Pycotools3

A set of tools for interacting with [COPASI simulation software](http://copasi.org/) from Python 3. The old repository that supports only Python 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/CiaranWelsh/pycotools) and the documentation for the old pycotools [here](). This is also the version that is described in detail in the the [bioinformatics publication](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty409/5001390). 

Since publication, several improvements have been made to pycotools. Firstly, pycotools3 is for Python3 only. This repository is kept separete from [pycotools](). Other differences exst and are described in the **[pycotools3 documentation](http://pycotools3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**


### Support 
I monitor stackoverflow questions for `pycotools` tags so you can ask a question there. Additionally, you may contact me on ciaran.welsh@newcastle.ac.uk. 

Contributions, ideas, suggestions, feature requests or anything generally geared towards improving the package are welcome.
